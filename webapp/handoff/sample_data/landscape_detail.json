  "report": "# Agumbe Rainforest Complex - FNE Assessment Report\n\n## Executive Summary\n**Overall FNE Score: 8.3 / 10 (Excellent)**\n\nThe Agumbe Rainforest Complex represents one of India's most functional natural ecosystems. Situated in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot, this 312 sq km landscape maintains near-pristine ecological relationships across all seven dimensions. Its standout feature is the deep reciprocity between Malnad communities and the rainforest ecosystem, built over centuries of co-existence.\n\n**Key finding:** Agumbe demonstrates that human presence within an ecosystem can enhance rather than diminish functionality when the relationship is reciprocal.\n\n## Landscape Profile\n- **Location:** Shimoga district, Karnataka\n- **Area:** 312 sq km\n- **Biome:** Tropical & Subtropical Moist Broadleaf Forests\n- **Key features:** One of the wettest places in India (7,600 mm annual rainfall), king cobra habitat, pristine rainforest canopy, Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary\n- **Human context:** Malnad communities with traditional agroforestry, moderate population density (~85/km2), growing eco-tourism sector\n\n## Key Strengths\n- Exceptional community-nature reciprocity rooted in centuries of traditional ecological knowledge\n- High biodiversity with intact food webs including apex predators\n- Excellent habitat connectivity with corridor to Kudremukh National Park\n- Strong hydrological regulation despite being one of India's wettest landscapes\n\n## Critical Concerns\n- Increasing tourism pressure threatening sensitive habitats\n- Climate change altering traditional rainfall patterns\n- Younger generation migration weakening knowledge transmission\n- Proposed infrastructure projects in buffer zones\n\n## Priority Actions\n1. Maintain and strengthen the Agumbe-Kudremukh corridor\n2. Support intergenerational transmission of traditional ecological practices\n3. Regulate tourism carrying capacity\n4. Monitor rainfall pattern shifts and their ecological impacts\n\n## Data Sources\nGLOBIO4, GBIF, WRI Aqueduct 4.0, ESA WorldCover 2021, Hansen GFC 2024, WDPA, ESVD, GRIP4, WorldPop, SRTM, MODIS NDVI",
