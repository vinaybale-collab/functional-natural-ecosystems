    "summary": "Agumbe Rainforest significantly outperforms Bannerghatta across all seven dimensions. The starkest contrasts are in Ecological Connectivity (6.0 point gap) and Community-Nature Reciprocity (6.5 point gap). Bannerghatta's proximity to Bangalore's urban sprawl creates extreme anthropogenic pressure (1.8/10) and has severed habitat connectivity (2.1/10). While Bannerghatta retains moderate biodiversity within its national park core (5.2/10), the surrounding landscape is heavily degraded. Agumbe benefits from intact Malnad community stewardship traditions and contiguous forest corridors."
